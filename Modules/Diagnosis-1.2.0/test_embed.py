"""Embeddable module UI tests for the diagnosis module.

Issue: replace the standalone HTML shell with an embeddable module UI
matching the "Add New Patient" pattern: ``createDiagnosisModule({root,
apiBaseUrl})``. The previous page baked a full standalone shell with a
"Back to dashboard" placeholder at index.html line 224. The new contract
makes the page an embeddable fn the host mounts with {root, apiBaseUrl};
the standalone GET / route bootstraps the same fn against ``document.body``.

This harness locks the embeddable UI contract:

1. served page bytes expose ``window.createDiagnosisModule`` (the host
   calls it; in embedded mode this is the only contract entry point);
2. served page no longer bakes a standalone shell header / topbar body
   markup at first paint — the .dm-topbar chrome is built ONLY by the
   function, gated on the ``embedded`` flag, so an embedded host does
   not get a second copy of the Insight topbar;
3. the served page no longer contains the placeholder "Back to dashboard"
   button text nor the standalone-shell body chrome that owned host
   navigation (host owns the back link / dashboard route);
4. ``page._read_page()`` still returns the same single string source
   of truth the page seam stamps the CSRF meta into (byte-clean under
   ``DIAGNOSIS_AUTH_BYPASS=1``); the route-order + pathset invariants
   (HANDOFF §9.4) are untouched — the route layer was not modified;
5. the standalone bootstrap path is self-contained: there is exactly one
   ``#diagnosis-root`` mount point in the served page, and the bootstrap
   calls ``createDiagnosisModule({root, apiBaseUrl: "", embedded: false})``
   against it.

We also exercise the function-level contract by extracting the JS source
from the served page and asserting on the parsed contract string — light,
no JS engine needed (a heuristic guard; the existing ponytail harnesses +
``test_routes`` cover the HTTP surface).

No test framework — ponytail style, mirrors ``test_routes.py`` /
``test_csrf.py``. Run: ``python -m test_embed``.
