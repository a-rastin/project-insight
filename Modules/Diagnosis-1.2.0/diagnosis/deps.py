"""Shared wiring for the diagnosis route seams.

The public router was split into three seams (see ``page.py``,
``dashboard.py``, ``diagnosis_api.py``). They all share:

- the process-wide ``DiagnosisStore`` instance (one SQLite connection,
  WAL journal; override path via ``DIAGNOSIS_DB_PATH``);
- the role-enforcement + CSRF dependencies, including the
  ``DIAGNOSIS_AUTH_BYPASS=1`` shim used by the in-process self-check and
  headless tests.

Centralising both here means the three seams never drift on policy or
store identity. Tests that reset the store import ``store`` from
``diagnosis.api`` (re-exported here for back-compat) — do not
instantiate ``DiagnosisStore`` elsewhere.

# ``DIAGNOSIS_AUTH_BYPASS=1`` short-circuits BOTH the role dep and the CSRF
# dep so the in-process self-check and headless tests can drive writes

# set in production — the import-time warning below makes any accidental
# carry-over loud before the server binds a port.
