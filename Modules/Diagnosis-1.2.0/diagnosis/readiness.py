"""Module-local health/readiness probe for the diagnosis module.

Liveness (``/health`` -> ``{"ok": True}``) only answers "is the process
up?". Readiness (``/ready``) answers "are this module's dependencies
configured + reachable so we can actually serve clinical traffic?".

The check is **module-local** and **never leaks secrets**:

- *DB* — we own a SQLite ``DiagnosisStore`` that the route handlers write
  clinical state through. We probe it with a ``SELECT 1`` on the same
  lazily opened connection ``store.py`` reuses (read from ``deps.store``
  at call time so the swap in the self-check / multi-deploy tests is
  honoured), so readiness reflects the live adapter the next request
  will hit, not a throwaway handle.
- *Auth* — we delegate trust to the Insight auth service via
  ``AUTH_BASE_URL``. We do NOT call it here: it sits behind the same
  ``Cookie`` the user sends, so calling it without one would either 401
  (false negative during a clean deploy) or leak the configured base URL
  / transport details to the caller. We only verify the module is
  *configured* to delegate (base URL resolves to a non-empty string) and
  the bypass shim is off — configuration shape, never the secret itself.
  The base URL value is deliberately NOT echoed in the response so an
  internal host name or IP is not surfaced to a caller.
- *Patient* — the patient identity adapter is opt-in via
  ``DIAGNOSIS_PATIENT_LOOKUP``. When disabled (default) the readiness
  state is "skipped" (the adapter short-circuits and never contacts the
  registry). When enabled we verify ``PATIENT_BASE_URL`` resolves to a
  non-empty string — same no-leak rule as Auth.
- *Clinical scope* — every exposed criteria entry needs an approved normalized
  coding mapping before clinical operations are available. It is feature state,
  not process readiness, so unresolved coding never marks healthy dependencies
  as unready.

Response shape (stable; do not drop keys without coordinating with the
larger Insight app's readiness aggregator):

    {
      "ok":        bool,             # AND of operational dependency checks
      "module":    "diagnosis",
      "checks":    {
          "db":      {"ok": bool},
          "auth":    {"ok": bool, "configured": bool, "bypass": bool},
          "patient": {"ok": bool, "enabled": bool, "configured": bool}
      }
    }

``bypass`` on the auth check is ``True`` when
``DIAGNOSIS_AUTH_BYPASS=1`` is set — the shim that shorts both the role
dependency and the CSRF gate for the in-process self-check. Surfacing
it here lets a deployment readiness gate fail loud when the bypass
shim is left on in production, without the readiness response itself
ever disclosing the auth-service URL.

A check the deploy operator can fly against this:

    curl /ready -> 200 + {"ok": true}                      -> serve traffic
    curl /ready -> 503 + {"ok": false, <which check>}      -> hold traffic

The HTTP route is in ``app.py`` (standalone mode); when mounted inside
the larger Insight app the parent app composes ``check_readiness()`` into
its own aggregator. See ``__init__.py`` for the lazy re-export.
