"""Browser page seam for the diagnosis module.

The single ``GET /`` route serves the standalone web app
(``static/index.html``) and stamps a fresh signed CSRF token into both a
``<meta name="csrf-token">`` tag in the page head and the matching
``csrf`` cookie on the response, so the JS can echo it back on the next
write without an extra fetch. This is the only browser-facing surface;
the diagnosis REST routes live in ``diagnosis_api.py`` and the Dashboard
discovery + audit snapshot hooks live in ``dashboard.py``.

The page is gated by the read policy (``psychiatrist`` or ``admin``) so
the SPA never loads for an unauthenticated viewer. Under the auth
bypass (self-check / headless tests) the meta/cookie injection is
skipped so the served page is byte-clean for asserts.
