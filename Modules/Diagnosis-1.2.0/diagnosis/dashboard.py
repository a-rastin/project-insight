"""Dashboard discovery seam for the diagnosis module.

This is the read-only discovery surface the larger Insight Dashboard (and
other internal integrators) use to learn what this module offers and to
pull audit snapshots of a clinician-confirmed / bypassed session. It
contains NO patient-state mutation — writes live in
``diagnosis_api.py``.

Routes (literal paths; must be declared before any ``/{code}`` route on
the composed router — see ``api.py``):
    GET /diagnosis/_meta   -> criteria tree + the ``rules`` contract
                              (``criteria.meta_contract``). Stable, no
                              patient data. UI bootstraps from this;
                              the ``rules`` block is the single source of
                              truth for the browser page's optimistic
                              display (HANDOFF §9.12).
    GET /diagnosis/_csrf   -> mint a signed double-submit CSRF token,
                              set the ``csrf`` cookie, return the same
                              value JSON-encoded. Read-only (no state
                              mutation).
    GET /internal/dashboard/module-routes/{moduleId}
                            -> Dashboard module-route discovery. The
                              larger Insight Dashboard asks every mounted
                              module for its launch descriptor through
                              this single URL pattern. The diagnosis
                              module answers for ``moduleId == "diagnosis"``
                              and 404s otherwise so a wrong-id call is
                              clean, not a stack trace. Read-only (no
                              state mutation).

Routes (cont.):
    GET /internal/diagnosis/audit/{code}
                            -> audit-log seam for the future Insight Logs
                              module (and other internal integrators).
                              Returns the chronologically ordered list of
                              persisted audit snapshots for ``code``. Read-
                              only (no state mutation). Lives under the
                              ``/internal/...`` prefix so its ``{code}``
                              param does NOT collide with the per-patient
                              ``/{code}`` family — same reasoning as the
                              dashboard discovery route. Auth: ``psychiatrist``
                              or ``admin`` (same read policy as ``_meta`` /
                              ``_csrf``); admins audit, never mutate.

Helpers:
    _dump_for_audit(code)  -> JSON snapshot for the larger Insight app's
                              audit logging. Persisted to the audit
                              table by ``store.audit_snapshot`` and NOW
                              also called from ``diagnosis_api.put_session``
                              on every decision-bearing PUT so local audit
                              events accumulate without waiting for an
                              external Logs module poll. Reserved surface —
                              don't expand without coordinating.
