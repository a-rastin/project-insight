# HANDOFF — `severity` module

> Read this first. Everything you need to use, modify, or extend this module is below. If a section doesn't answer your question, the source file named in that section will.

## 1. What this module is

A **standalone web app and Insight sub-module** for PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) schizophrenia severity assessment. Psychiatrist-facing, API-first.

- **Two roles at once:**
  1. **Standalone app** — open `http://localhost:3000`, type a patient code, run the 30-item PANSS questionnaire.
  2. **Insight sub-module** — a parent app talks to it over REST. No other integration surface. CORS is open so the parent can call it cross-origin/port.
- **Domain:** clinical decision support. PANSS = 30 items, each rated 1 (Absent) → 7 (Extreme). Subscales: Positive P1–P7 (7 items), Negative N1–N7 (7 items), General Psychopathology G1–G16 (16 items). Total raw range 30–210.
- **Design contract:** follows a sibling `DESIGN.md` (not committed here) — teal `#0A9E8F` accent, Inter body, JetBrains Mono for codes/scores, 2px teal focus rings, "clinician-control" wording (`Decision-support recommendation. Psychiatrist final review required.` — never "AI prescription").

The whole module is **deliberately minimal** (a project-wide philosophy called "ponytail" — see §10). SQLite, build tooling, and auth exist as documented deferrals, not gaps.

## 2. Repo layout (only 4 source files matter)

```

├── package.json           # single dep: express. "type":"module". npm start -> node server.js
├── server.js              # the entire backend: REST API + static server + CORS (149 lines)
├── test_api.js            # assert-based self-check, no test framework (91 lines)

```

- `README.md` — user-facing overview; mirrors most of this but lighter.
- `package-lock.json`, `node_modules/` — standard.
- Everything else in `node_modules/` is transitive Express deps. **Do not touch.**

---

## 3. Stack & runtime

| Layer | Tech | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | Node.js + Express 4 | **Single dependency.** ESM (`"type":"module"`). |
| Persistence | JSON file at `data/assessments.json` | Flat object keyed by `patient_code`. No schema, no migrations, no locks. |
| Frontend | One HTML file | Tailwind via CDN (`cdn.tailwindcss.com`), Google Fonts (Inter + JetBrains Mono), vanilla JS. **Zero build step.** |
| Test | `node test_api.js` | Native `assert` + native `fetch`. No test runner, no fixtures. |

**Run:**
```powershell
npm install      # one-time
npm start        # node server.js -> http://localhost:3000
```

**Self-check:**
```powershell
node test_api.js   # starts server on PORT=4567, asserts GET/PUT flows, exits 0/1
```

**Port:** `process.env.PORT || 3000`. The test file forces `4567` so it doesn't collide with a running dev server.

---

## 4. Backend — `server.js` (149 lines, the whole thing)

Read it end-to-end before editing. It is small on purpose.

### 4.1 Boot sequence
1. Resolve `__dirname` via `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)` (ESM has no `__dirname`).
2. Define `DATA_DIR` and `DATA_FILE` (= `<repo>/data/assessments.json`).
3. **Create `data/` dir and an empty `{}` file if missing** — so first run never crashes on read.
4. Wire middleware in this order (order matters):
   - `express.json()` — body parser
   - `express.static(public/)` — serves `index.html` at `/`
   - **CORS middleware** (manual `setHeader`, not the `cors` package) — `*` origin, methods `GET, PUT, OPTIONS`, headers `Content-Type`. Short-circuits `OPTIONS` to `200`.

### 4.2 Helpers
- `readAssessments()` — `fs.readFileSync` → `JSON.parse`. On any error, logs and returns `{}` (treats DB as empty rather than crashing the request). **This is deliberate but means a corrupted file silently wipes the view** — see §8.
- `writeAssessments(data)` — `fs.writeFileSync` pretty-printed. Returns `true`/`false`; caller turns `false` into a `500`.

> **No locking.**`fs.writeFileSync` is synchronous and atomic-ish for small files but there is **no concurrent-write protection**. Single-user localhost assumption. This is the #1 seam to upgrade if the module moves to multi-user (see §9).

### 4.3 Routes — only two exist

All routes are prefixed `/api/severity/:patient_code`. JSON in/out. There is **no list endpoint, no delete, no patch.**

#### `GET /api/severity/:patient_code`  (`server.js:60`)
- `400` if `patient_code` empty/whitespace.
- Looks up `assessments[patient_code]`.
- **If found → returns the stored object as-is.**
- **If not found → returns a fresh `pending` skeleton:**
  ```json
  {
    "patient_code": "<code>",
    "status": "pending",
    "items": {},
    "scores": { "total": 0, "positive": 0, "negative": 0, "general": 0 }
  }
  ```
  This is how the frontend bootstraps a new assessment. There is no "create" call — GET *is* the create-if-absent.

#### `PUT /api/severity/:patient_code`  (`server.js:88`)
Validates, then **overwrites** `assessments[patient_code]` (no merge, no history).
- `400` if `patient_code` empty.
- `400` if `status` missing or not in `["completed", "passed"]`.
- **If `status === "passed"`** → stores `{ patient_code, status:"passed", updated_at }`. No scores, no items.
- **If `status === "completed"`** → additionally requires:
  - `scores` with `total`, `positive`, `negative`, `general` all numbers (`typeof === "number"`).
  - `items` is an object (only checks `typeof items === "object"`, **not** that all 30 are present or in 1–7 range — trust boundary is the frontend).
  - Stores `{ patient_code, status:"completed", scores, items, updated_at }`.
- `writeAssessments` → `200 { success: true, data: <stored> }` or `500 { error: "Failed to write to database" }`.
- `updated_at` is `new Date().toISOString()` — server-generated, not client-trusted.

#### Catch-all  (`server.js:134`)
```js
app.get("*", (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.path.startsWith("/api/")) return next();  // let unknown /api/* 404
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "public", "index.html"));
});
```
This is **only a GET catch-all** — note `app.get`, not `app.use`. It exists so the standalone SPA can support client-side routing / deep links. Unknown `/api/*` falls through to Express's default 404.

> ⚠ **There is no DELETE route.** To wipe a patient's record, edit `data/assessments.json` by hand. Do not add one unless the parent app genuinely needs it (see §9).

### 4.4 Where to make changes
- **New route?** Add it between the GET and the catch-all, or the catch-all will swallow it. Remember it's `app.get("*", ...)` so any HTTP method other than GET bypasses the catch-all automatically; for new GET routes, define them *above* line 134.
- **New field on a stored assessment?** Update both the GET skeleton (line 73) and the PUT write branch (line 102 or 117), plus the frontend consumer. There is no schema file — the schema *is* the inline object literals.
- **Validation lives inline in the route**, not in a middleware. Don't extract a validator unless you have 3+ routes.

## 5. Frontend — `public/index.html` (830 lines, single file)

No framework, no build. Open the file directly; everything happens in one `<script>` block at the bottom.

### 5.1 Page structure (top → bottom of body)
1. `<header>` — Insight brand, `v1.0.0-alpha` tag, active patient badge (hidden until a patient loads), hard-coded "Welcome Dr. Amiral" greeting.
2. `#notification` — toast container, hidden by default, populated by `showNotification()`.
3. `<main>` with **two mutually exclusive views** toggled via `hidden` class:
   - `#view-lookup` — patient code entry form + recent-assessments list.
   - `#view-assessment` — the actual PANSS workspace (two-column on desktop).
4. The workspace:
   - **Left column** — sticky tab bar (P / N / G) + `#items-container` where rows are injected by `renderForm()`.
   - **Right column (sticky on desktop)** — "Evaluation Context" card, progress + score totals card, real-time "Clinical Interpretation" card, and the action buttons (`Save Completed Evaluation`, `Pass`, `Dashboard`).
5. `<script>` — all logic. ~520 lines. No external JS files.

### 5.2 Constants
- `PANSS_ITEMS` (line 308) — array of 30 `{ code, scale, name, desc }` objects. **Source of truth for the questionnaire.** Order is P then N then G. If you need to add/rename an item, edit here *and* the badges / maxes are derived from `.scale` counts, so they self-update.
- `SCORE_DESCRIPTIONS` (line 346) — map `1..7` → label (`Absent`, `Minimal`, `Mild`, `Moderate`, `Moderate Severe`, `Severe`, `Extreme`). Used for tooltips and the per-row indicator.

### 5.3 State (module-scope `let`s, line 357)
- `currentPatientCode` — null until a patient loads.
- `currentTab` — `"P" | "N" | "G"`, defaults `"P"`.
- `answers` — `{ "P1": 4, "N1": 2, ... }`. **Flattened across all 30 items**, not per-tab.

There is **no state library.** Re-render is full (`renderForm()`) on every score click. It's cheap at 30 rows; do not optimize unless profiling says otherwise.

### 5.4 Key functions

| Function | Line | Job |
|---|---|---|
| `DOMContentLoaded` listener | 362 | Wires lookup form submit, loads recent list, checks `?patient_code=` / `?code=` URL param for deep-link. |
| `fetchRecentAssessments()` | 384 | Reads `localStorage["panss_recent_patients"]` (last 5). **Not** an API call — there's no list endpoint. Purely client-side memory. |
| `saveToRecentList(code)` | 415 | Pushes code to front of `localStorage` list, de-dupe, cap 5. |
| `loadPatient(code)` | 428 | `GET /api/severity/<code>`. Sets `currentPatientCode`, updates URL via `history.pushState` (no reload), seed `answers` from `data.items` if status was `completed`, swaps views, updates header badge + status badge, then `renderForm()` + `updateRealtimeCalculations()`. |
| `renderForm()` | 481 | Filters `PANSS_ITEMS` by `currentTab`, builds one row per item. Each row: code + name + desc on the left; a 1–7 button group + a textual severity indicator on the right. **Rebuilds the entire list on each call.** |
| `switchTab(scale)` | 550 | Sets `currentTab`, retoggles tab button classes, re-renders. |
| `selectScore(itemCode, score)` | 567 | Mutates `answers`, re-renders, recalculates. |
| `clearAssessmentForm()` | 576 | `confirm()`-guarded wipe of `answers` + re-render. Called by the "Reset Form" link. |
| `updateRealtimeCalculations()` | 585 | **The brains.** See 5.5. |
| `submitAssessment(statusType)` | 713 | `PUT /api/severity/<code>` with either `{status:"passed"}` or `{status:"completed", scores, items}`. On success: toast + `setTimeout(backToDashboard, 1500)`. |
| `backToDashboard()` | 772 | Resets state, strips URL params via `pushState`, swaps views back to lookup. |
| `showNotification(title, message, type)` | 795 | Toast. `type` ∈ `normal|warning|urgent`. Auto-hides after 4 s. |

### 5.5 `updateRealtimeCalculations()` — read this twice

This is the single function that derives everything visible in the right panel. Called after every score click and after `loadPatient`.

1. **Counts and sums per scale** by iterating `PANSS_ITEMS` and looking up `answers[item.code]`.
2. **Tab badges** — `${counts.X}/${maxes.X}`. Styled: all-done → green (`normal`), partial → amber (`warning`), none → grey.
3. **Progress** — `totalRatedCount / 30`, rounded. Updates `#progress-text` and `#progress-bar` width.
4. **Score summary** — `score-p/n/g-text` shows the sum, or `"-"` if nothing rated on that scale. `score-total-text` = grand total or `"-"`.
5. **Submit gate** — `#btn-submit` (`Save Completed Evaluation`) is enabled **iff** `totalRatedCount === 30`. `Pass` is always enabled.
6. **Clinical interpretation text** — three branches:
   - `totalRatedCount === 0` → "PENDING", placeholder copy.
   - `< 30` → "INCOMPLETE", running totals in copy.
   - `=== 30` → full interpretation:
     - **Severity bucket** by `grandTotal`: `≤30` Absent/Normal, `31–58` Mild (this is the `let severity = "Mild"` default), `59–75` Moderate, `76–95` Marked/Severe, `≥96` Extreme. **Bands are hardcoded** — change here to retune.
     - **Predominant subscale** by ratio: `sums.P/49`, `sums.N/49`, `sums.G/112` (where 49 = 7×7 and 112 = 16×7, the max possible per subscale). Whichever ratio is highest drives the narrative sentence.
     - Composes an HTML string with patient code, total, severity label, predominant narrative, and the italic disclaimer line.

> ⚠ **Severity bands are a clinical convention, not a law.** They live inline in this function. If a clinician asks to retune thresholds, this is the only place to edit. Do NOT silently change these — they have clinical meaning.

### 5.6 Where to make changes
- **Add a PANSS item?** Push to `PANSS_ITEMS`. Badges/maxes derive from `.scale`, so a new P8 / N8 / G17 just works. If you change the *count* of a subscale, update `maxes` inline in `updateRealtimeCalculations` (line 588) and the `30` literals in progress (line 619, 635, 652, 663) — there is no shared `TOTAL_ITEMS` constant; that's a known ponytail deferral.
- **Change severity bands?** §5.5 step 6. Keep the clinical disclaimer text intact.
- **New UI section?** It's one HTML file. Find an adjacent card, copy its structure, wire it in `updateRealtimeCalculations()` or a new function. Tailwind classes are inline; the custom palette is in the `tailwind.config` block in `<head>` (line 16).
- **Don't** add React/Vue/a bundler unless component count genuinely demands it. The single-file design is the point — see §9.

## 6. Data model

`data/assessments.json` is a flat JSON object, `<patient_code> → assessment`:

```json
{
  "PAT-2940-X": {
    "patient_code": "PAT-2940-X",
    "status": "completed",
    "scores": { "total": 120, "positive": 28, "negative": 30, "general": 62 },
    "items":   { "P1": 4, "P2": 3, "...": "...", "G16": 2 },
    "updated_at": "2026-07-06T03:30:01.218Z"
  },
  "PAT-OTHER": {
    "patient_code": "PAT-OTHER",
    "status": "passed",
    "updated_at": "2026-07-06T03:31:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

- **Keys** are patient codes as-typed-by-the-caller. The frontend uppercases (`code.trim().toUpperCase()`) before sending/storing; the backend does **not** normalize. If a parent app calls the API directly with `pat-2940-x` (lowercase), it will create a *different* record from the frontend's `PAT-2940-X`. Either normalize in the parent, or add a `.toUpperCase()` in the backend routes — currently a latent footgun.
- **No history / no versions.** PUT is overwrite. Prior state is gone.
- **No expiry, no cleanup.** The file grows monotonically.
- `updated_at` is server-set on PUT; GET for a pending skeleton has no `updated_at`.

---

## 7. API contract (cheat sheet)

| Method | Path | Body | Success | Errors |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/severity/:patient_code` | — | `200` stored record **or** `200` pending skeleton | `400` empty code |
| PUT | `/api/severity/:patient_code` | `{status:"passed"}` | `200 {success:true, data:{...}}` | `400` empty code / bad status / bad scores / bad items; `500` write fail |
| PUT | `/api/severity/:patient_code` | `{status:"completed", scores:{total,positive,negative,general}, items:{P1:1..7, ...}}` | same | same |
| GET | any non-`/api/*` | — | serves `index.html` (SPA fallback) | — |
| OPTIONS | any | — | `200` (CORS preflight) | — |

**No list, no delete, no patch, no auth.** CORS is `*`.

---

## 8. Known sharp edges & footguns

These are intentional minimalism, not bugs — but they will bite if you forget.

1. **No backend case normalization.** `pat-2940-x` and `PAT-2940-X` are different records. Frontend uppercases; direct API callers may not.
2. **`readAssessments()` swallows corruption.** A malformed `assessments.json` returns `{}` silently — looks like an empty DB, doesn't error. If records "disappear", check the file contents first.
3. **No concurrency lock.** Two PUTs racing → last writer wins, no conflict signal. Single-user-localhost assumption.
4. **PUT validation is shallow.** `completed` accepts an `items` object with any keys, not just `P1..G16`, and does not range-check `1..7`. Trust boundary is the frontend. If a parent app writes directly, validate on its side.
5. **`scores` are client-computed and trusted.** Backend only checks the four fields are numbers. A malicious/buggy client can store `total` inconsistent with `items`. The frontend recomputes in `submitAssessment()` (line 722) before sending — but a direct API caller bypasses that.
6. **`app.get("*")` catch-all** is GET-only. A `POST /foo` will 404 cleanly; a `GET /api/unknown` will pass to `next()` and Express returns its default 404 (HTML, not JSON). Don't expect JSON 404s for unknown `/api/*` GETs.
7. **`fetchRecentAssessments` is local-only.** The "Recent Assessments" list on the lookup screen is per-browser `localStorage`, not a server query. Two different machines see different "recent" lists.
8. **Hardcoded `30` literals** appear in the frontend in several places instead of a derived constant. If you change the item count, grep `30` in `index.html`.
9. **"Welcome Dr. Amiral"** and `v1.0.0-alpha` are hardcoded strings, not config.
10. **`node_modules/` is committed in this repo** (per `git ls-files`). Not normal for a real project. Don't add to it; don't prune it in a PR without asking — it may be intentional for the standalone deployment story.

---

## 9. Intentionally deferred (the "ponytail ledger")

Per the project's ponytail philosophy, these are *deliberate* simplifications with a named trigger to add them. Each is meant to be a one-rung jump, not a rewrite. Matched to source seams:

| Skip | Why it's fine today | Add when | Where the seam is |
|---|---|---|---|
| SQLite / Prisma / migrations | Single-user localhost; JSON holds | Concurrent writes, audit-grade schema, querying across patients | `readAssessments`/`writeAssessments` in `server.js:38-57` |
| DELETE route | Not needed by any caller | Parent app needs to retract a record | add `app.delete("/api/severity/:patient_code", …)` above the catch-all in `server.js:134` |
| Auth (JWT/session) | Parent Insight app owns identity | Module exposed beyond localhost or needs standalone login | middleware slot before CORS in `server.js:22` |
| React/Vue/Vite/TS | Single-file HTML is readable, no bundle penalty | Component count grows; types start paying for themselves | all of `public/index.html` |
| `TOTAL_ITEMS` constant | 30 is small and obvious | A subscale item count changes and the literals drift | literals in `updateRealtimeCalculations` `index.html:588,619,635,652,663` |
| List endpoint (`GET /api/severity`) | Frontend uses `localStorage` recents | Parent app needs to enumerate saved assessments | add route before the catch-all |
| Build/CSS pipeline | Tailwind CDN is fine for one page | Second page, or offline-only deployment | `<script src="cdn.tailwindcss.com">` in `index.html:14` |

**To upgrade any of these:** make the smallest change that holds, leave a `ponytail:` comment naming what was skipped and the trigger to revisit, and don't refactor surrounding code in the same change.

---

## 10. The "ponytail" philosophy (context, not legal)

This module was built under a project-wide discipline called **ponytail** — ship the smallest thing that works, defer everything speculative, and **mark every deferral** with a `ponytail:` comment so it's traceable instead of rotting. The rules you'll see applied throughout:

- Stdlib / native platform first, then the smallest diff that holds.
- No abstraction with one implementation, no factory for one product, no config for a value that never changes.
- Deletion > addition. Boring > clever.
- Never simplify away: input validation at trust boundaries, error handling that prevents data loss, security, accessibility basics.
- Every non-trivial piece of logic leaves **one runnable check** behind (`test_api.js` is that check here — no test framework on purpose).

When you extend this module, **match the style**: read the file fully, find the smallest change that holds, leave a `ponytail:` comment if you cut a corner, and don't add a dependency. README §"Intentionally deferred" mirrors this ledger — keep the two in sync if you change the deferral set.

---

## 11. How to verify your change

1. `node test_api.js` — must print `SUCCESS: All integration tests passed successfully!` and exit 0. This exercises GET-new → PUT-passed → GET-verify-passed → PUT-completed → GET-verify-completed against a throwaway server on port 4567.
2. `npm start` and open `http://localhost:3000`:
   - Enter `TEST-FOO`, rate all 30 items, hit **Save Completed Evaluation** → toast → returns to lookup.
   - Re-enter `TEST-FOO` → status badge should say **Completed**, all 30 scores pre-filled.
   - Enter `TEST-BAR`, hit **Pass** → toast → returns to lookup. Re-enter `TEST-BAR` → badge **Passed / Skipped**.
   - Deep-link test: `http://localhost:3000/?patient_code=TEST-FOO` should land straight in the workspace.
3. Inspect `data/assessments.json` — should contain your test records with `updated_at` timestamps.

The self-check does **not** clean up `data/assessments.json` (it uses a real `TEST-PATIENT-99` key). If you need a pristine DB, delete the file — server recreates `{}` on next boot.

---

## 12. If you only read three things

1. **`server.js`** — the entire backend, 149 lines. Read it all.
2. **`updateRealtimeCalculations()` in `public/index.html:585`** — the clinical logic (severity bands, predominant-symptom narrative, submit gate). Read twice.
3. **§9 ledger above** — before adding *anything*, check whether it's already on the deferred list and what the trigger is. Don't pay down deferrals speculatively; don't add new ones silently.

The shortest correct change is the right change.
