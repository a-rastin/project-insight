# Dashboard Module

Dashboard is a standalone web app and embeddable module. Boundary rule: internal REST only. Dashboard never imports Authentication code, decodes JWTs, reads an auth DB, or implements patient/admin module workflows.

Backend is Python FastAPI with SQLite persistence behind a repository/DB adapter layer. Dashboard persists only local session/event rows; Authentication remains source of truth for users, roles, and profile display data. `DASHBOARD_DB_PATH` controls SQLite file location and defaults to `dashboard.sqlite3` in this directory.

## Run

```powershell
npm start
```

Equivalent direct command:

```powershell
python -m uvicorn dashboard_backend.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173
```

Open `http://localhost:4173/dashboard/`.

Without `AUTH_BASE_URL` or `AUTH_SESSION_URL`, Dashboard serves a mock `GET /api/auth/session` endpoint for standalone development. Set `DASHBOARD_MOCK_AUTH=0` in integrated environments if a real auth endpoint is required.

## Test

```powershell
npm test
```

## Health

```http
GET /healthz
GET /readyz
```

`/readyz` checks DB connectivity.

## Workspace Rules

- Both roles enter `Workspace`.
- Workspace responses include `currentDateTime` and `displayName`.
- Psychiatrist display names use `Dr. {fullName}`.
- Psychiatrist buttons: `Add New Patient`, `Patient Follow-up`, `List of Patients`, `Setting`.
- Admin button: `User Management`.
- Button routes through REST-discovered Authentication-owned user-management module.
- Dashboard does not implement patient, treatment, admin log, backup, or user-management module logic.

## Module Interface

Authentication identity is verified through REST:

```http
GET /api/auth/session
```

Dashboard activation uses only Dashboard's internal REST endpoint:

```http
POST /internal/dashboard/session
```

The caller supplies auth credentials through `Authorization`, `Cookie`, or `X-Auth-Session`. Request body identity fields are ignored; Dashboard calls Authentication to get `user.id`, `role`, and display profile. Dashboard rejects missing, expired, forced-password-change, password-reset-required, and disclaimer-blocked auth sessions.

The UI then reads:

```http
GET /internal/dashboard/workspace
```

Buttons discover module placeholders through:

```http
GET /internal/dashboard/module-routes/{moduleId}
```

Every protected Dashboard endpoint verifies the local dashboard session and re-checks Authentication through `GET /api/auth/session`.

## Postgres Upgrade Path

Route handlers depend on `DashboardRepository`, not SQLite directly. SQL access is isolated behind `DatabaseAdapter`; replacing `SQLiteAdapter` with a Postgres adapter should preserve REST behavior and repository method contracts.
